# Passenger-Counting-System
project is a vehicle counting system that uses infrared (IR) sensors to monitor the number of vehicles entering and exiting a particular area, such as a parking lot. The system employs an ESP8266 microcontroller, which connects to a Wi-Fi network to transmit the count data to ThingSpeak, a cloud-based data platform for the Internet of Things (IoT).
